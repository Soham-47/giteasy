# GitEasy

A beginner-friendly Git utility that makes pushing changes to GitHub effortless.

GitEasy is designed for those who are new to Git and want a **no-hassle**, **one-command** way to add, commit, and push code to a GitHub repository — all from the terminal.
GitEasy streamlines discovering and contributing to beginner-friendly GitHub issues using smart filtering and real-time updates.

## ❓ Why GitEasy?

For beginners, Git commands can feel intimidating — especially when you just want to update your project without memorizing flags and command chains.

**GitEasy solves this** by wrapping all essential Git operations into a single, guided Python script that:
- Stages your changes
- Prompts you for a commit message
- Authenticates with GitHub
- Pushes your changes to the right branch

Finding a beginner-friendly issue across thousands of repositories is overwhelming:

- "Good first issue" tags are often misleading or outdated.
- Many projects are inactive or poorly maintained.
- Beginners waste hours just searching.

**GitEasy changes the game** by delivering curated, beginner-friendly issues at your fingertips—no more guesswork or wasted time.

***No GitHub Desktop, no GUI. Just Python + terminal convenience.***

## 🎓 How are we better than others?

- **Smart Issue Discovery**  
  Categorized issues across types like documentation, UI, bugs, testing, and more, tailored to your skill level.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Auto-refreshes every few minutes so you never miss new opportunities.

- **Flexible Filtering**  
  Choose by programming language (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C++…), difficulty (Beginner → Advanced), and project quality.

- **Hybrid Ranking Algorithm**  
  Combines issue recency (60%) and repo popularity (stars) — to surface timely, relevant issues.

- **Beautiful & Responsive Design**  
  Sleek modern UI using glass-morphism, with dark mode, fluid layouts, and smooth animations.

- **Privacy-First Approach**  
  No backend storage—your session and preferences stay in the browser. Your GitHub token is encrypted and cleaned up automatically.
